## Overview:
 This study demonstrates the interdependence of every aspect of flying on the price of an airline ticket. As part of the research, an extensive dataset of 10683 flight records from various airlines was gathered and utilised to develop a Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression model. There is a significant difference in accuracy between the Linear Regression(62.5%), Decision Tree Regressor model(71.7%) and the random forest model(82.9%) when it comes to predicting flight delays and cancellations.
## Motivation:
What should you do if you're stuck at home because of the pandemic? To get the most out of it, I started learning Machine Learning models. I learned the mathematics that underpins all supervised models. Finally, in order to make a difference, it is critical to focus on application (real-world application).
## Installation:
Python 3.6.10 is used to write the code. You can get Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't already have it installed. If you're using an older version of Python, you may upgrade by installing the pip package, which will ensure you have the most recent version of pip. After [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/), execute this command in the project directory to install the needed packages and libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
